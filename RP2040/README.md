# rp2040 Code
This folder contains the instructions and relevant files for programming the microcontroller

## Development Board
For this project we chose the Adafruit Feather RP2040. This project uses Adafruit's CircuitPython, which include some libraries specific to their feather line of boards. The code for this project is only expected to run on the Adafruit Feather RP2040, but could be modified to work on other boards.
